Web application for detecting pneumonia using artificial intelligence

Adi Abayev

This study is devoted to the development of a web application based on the method of automatic recognition of pneumonia using convolutional neural networks (CNN). As part of the project, a computer model based on the Keras Tensorflow library for Python was created. The main stages of the work were: learning the basics of neural networks, collecting and preprocessing data, developing and debugging a program, analyzing the results, developing and debugging a web application using the streamlit library.
The proposed model demonstrated a high accuracy of pneumonia recognition, reaching 95-97%, which confirms its potential for practical use in medical institutions. This work highlights the importance of introducing artificial intelligence technologies into diagnostic processes, opening up opportunities to increase their effectiveness.
Project hypothesis: the use of artificial intelligence is able to recognize and diagnose the presence of pneumonia in a patient based on an X-ray image.

This web application uses a model developed by us and trained on training data. The application has a clear and simple interface that makes it easier for any medical professional to use the application and does not require special knowledge in the field of information technology.
When launching the application in the browser window that opens, the user can upload an X-ray image using the Browse Files button or by dragging and dropping the file using Drag and Drop technology. After that, the application displays the result within a few seconds: Pneumonia detected or Pneumonia not detected. At the initial stage of using this application, it is recommended that an additional diagnosis be performed by experienced medical personnel.

To launch the application, you need to download the file pneumonia.py to the local computer, as well as the pre-trained pneumonia_detection_cnn_model.keras model from Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ND8ozibAeCurV5XObAyJuCQiSUx6HM52 ?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ND8ozibAeCurV5XObAyJuCQiSUx6HM52?usp=sharing)
